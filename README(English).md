# Tasks-P1-SI-CIN-UFPE-2022.2

Tasks for the Programming 1 (P1) course of the Information Systems (SI) program at the Center for Informatics (CIN) of the Federal University of Pernambuco (UFPE), a course I took in the second half of 2022 and first half of 2023.

The scoring activities for the course include the lists in this repository and a final project. Check the project in this other repository: https://github.com/luiz-linkezio/projeto-p1-equipe7

The first set of activities was the Training List, followed by List 1, then List 2, and so on up to List 6.

**Note:** There was an extra list to help improve the scores of those who didn't achieve the maximum grade in the previous lists, but I managed to get the maximum grade, so I didn't do this extra list. Additionally, there was a final exam list, but I didn't need to take it since I passed by average.

## File Organization

In the `Listas` directory, there are several folders containing the tasks for each list. Each list has a specific theme, and each folder within each list contains a folder for each task. These task folders contain an `.md` file showing the question statement and a `.py` file with the solution to the problem in Python code format, which was done by me.

## Course Syllabus

Basic concepts of algorithms; basic concepts of programming languages; basic concepts of object-oriented programming and software quality; programming environment; control structures and composite data structures; files; basic concepts of data structures; implementation design.

## Task Proposal

The tasks in this repository are tasks that should be solved using the **Python** programming language. These activities aim to introduce students to programming concepts and logic in an introductory manner.

## Rules:

- Students completed one list at a time and had a deadline to submit the activities of each list. The deadline varied depending on the list, but the longest deadline established for the course was 1 month.
- Each list had a minimum and maximum score from 0 to 10, respectively, and each question was worth the same score. The lists accounted for 70% of the course grade, and the final project accounted for 30%.
- Students were not allowed to use any content from future lists, meaning it was not permitted to use Tuples (List 6) in the tasks of List 1.
- Some questions have their own rules, such as requiring the use of a specific function, for example.
- Students and tasks were monitored to prevent any copying of answers from other students.

## My Grade in the Course:
### I achieved the maximum grade in the course (ranging from 0 to 10).
